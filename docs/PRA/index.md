# Practical Regression and Anova in R

*The material in this text is old and has been superceded by* 
[Linear Models with R](../LMR)

This book is derived from material that I have taught in a class 
(STAT500) at the University of Michigan twenty years ago. This was a
masters level course covering the following topics:Linear Models:
Definition, fitting, inference, interpretation of results, meaning of
regression coefficients, identifiablity, lack of fit, multicollinearity,
ridge regression, principal components regression, partial least
squares, regression splines, Gauss-Markov theorem, variable selection,
diagnostics, transformations, influential observations, robust
procedures, ANOVA and analysis of covariance, randomised block,
factorial designs.

To take full advantage of the book, you will need to obtain a copy of R
which may be obtained free of charge from the [R web
site](http://www.r-project.org). (There is also an accompanying package of data and R
functions for the book.

-   The book refers to many datasets that can be found in the *faraway* package that 
you will need to install in R. You can do this using the "Tools->Install Packages"
menu in Rstudio or the "Packages and Data" menu in the R GUI. Alternatively, you
can install the [development version](https://github.com/julianfaraway/faraway)
