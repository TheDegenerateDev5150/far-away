# Linear Models with R

## by Julian Faraway

The book refers to many datasets that can be found in the *faraway* package that 
you will need to install in R. You can do this using the "Tools->Install Packages"
menu in Rstudio or the "Packages and Data" menu in the R GUI. Alternatively, you
can install the [development version](https://github.com/julianfaraway/faraway)

-   The book refers to many datasets that can only be found in the
    "faraway" package that needs to be added to R. Windows and Macintosh
    users will find it most convenient to select the "Install packages
    from CRAN" option under the "Package" menu while running R, and then
    choose "faraway" from the list of packages. A source version of the
    code can be obtained from the [R web
    site](http://www.r-project.org).
-   The [data](../book/jfdata.zip) from the `faraway` package in ASCII
    format. These are provided for the convenience of users of
    statistical software other than R. Users of R should install the
    `faraway` package.
-   The [R commands](scripts/) used in text.
