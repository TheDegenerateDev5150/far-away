# Jupyter notebooks for *Linear Models with R, Second Edition* in Python

I have translated most of the R code in the book into Python. Sometimes
the Python output is similar but not the same. In a few cases, there is
no available Python package equivalent to that found with R. I have long
experience with R but not so much with Python so any suggestions for
more elegant Python would be welcome.

Read more about it in this [blog post](https://julianfaraway.github.io/post/linear-models-with-r-translated-to-python/)

Here are the data as [lmrcsv.zip](lmrcsv.zip) as CSV files.

You will commonly need several Python packages including `numpy`,
`scipy`, `pandas`, `statsmodels`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`,
`scikit-learn` and `patsy`. I recommend the [Anaconda
distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) of Python which
includes these packages.
