# Books that use R by Julian Faraway

1. [Linear Models with R](LMR/)  

2. [Extending the Linear Model with R](ELM/)

3. [Practical Regression and ANOVA with R](PRA/)

[Bayesian Regression with INLA](https://github.com/julianfaraway/brinla) also uses
R but functions and data from that book are available in a separate package.
