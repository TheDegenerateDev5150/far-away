# Extending the Linear Model with R

## Julian Faraway

## R package

The book refers to many datasets that can be found in the *faraway* package that 
you will need to install in R. You can do this using the "Tools->Install Packages"
menu in Rstudio or the "Packages and Data" menu in the R GUI. Alternatively, you
can install the [development version](https://github.com/julianfaraway/faraway)

- The [R commands](scripts/index.md)  used in text.
- The [Errata](errata.md).
- The `lme4` package, used to  fit models with random effects and used extensively in Chapters 8 and 9, has
  undergone substantial changes since the publication of the book. Please read about these [changes](mixchange.md)
  along with some suggested solutions. (last updated April 2015).
