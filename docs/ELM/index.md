# Extending the Linear Model with R

## Julian Faraway

The book refers to many datasets that can be found in the *faraway* package that 
you will need to install in R. You can do this using the "Tools->Install Packages"
menu in Rstudio or the "Packages and Data" menu in the R GUI. Alternatively, you
can install the [development version](https://github.com/julianfaraway/faraway)
